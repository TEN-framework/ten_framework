# The `ten_rust` crate will be used in the following two ways:
#
# 1. Used as a dependency in other Rust crates, ex: tman. In this case, the
# crate type can not be `staticlib`, as the native library can not be
# interpreted by rustc in the linkage. Instead, the crate should be compiled
# into a `rlib`, which is a Rust static library, and can be interpreted by rustc
# in the linkage.
#
# 2. Used as a native library in other languages, ex: ten runtime. In this case,
# the crate type should be a native static or dynamic library. That's what the
# `staticlib` crate type is for.
