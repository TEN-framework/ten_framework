/**
 * @brief Describes the protocol chain relationship and closing process.
 *
 * The protocol chain has the following structure:
 *
 *   base protocol (ten_protocol_t) -->
 *                 implementation protocol (inherited from ten_protocol_t)
 *
 * A base protocol can only be closed when its implementation protocol has been
 * closed. The closing process occurs in two stages:
 *
 * - Stage 1: Top-down 'Need to close' notification
 *
 *   TEN world -> (notify close) ->
 *                base protocol -> (notify close) ->
 *                                 implementation protocol
 *
 * - Stage 2: Bottom-up 'I am closed' notification
 *
 *   implementation protocol -> (notify closed) ->
 *   base protocol -> (notify closed) ->
 *   TEN world
 *
 * A protocol (whether base or implementation) can only be fully closed when all
 * resources it holds have been properly released. This ensures orderly shutdown
 * and prevents resource leaks.

  //   function will be called whenever any resource is closed.

 * the close operation is deferred. Otherwise, it proceeds with closing the
 * protocol by changing its state to CLOSED and invoking the registered
