// withCGO is used to ensure that the number of OS threads in the application
// will be limited, as new OS thread might be created due to a syscall such as
// cgo call.
//
// Why a new OS thread might be created when there is a syscall (ex: cgo call)
// in a Goroutine?
//
//  1. Once a GO application starts, it creates some idle Processor (i.e., P),
//     the number of Ps are specified by GOMAXPROCS (the number of cpu cores).
//
//  2. When a Goroutine (i.e., G) is created by the syntax `go func() {}()`, a
//     new round of go scheduler starts.
//
//  3. During each scheduler, an idle P shall be found. And then P picks one
//     Goroutine in runnable status. Each P has a runnable list of G, and also
//     there is a global runnable list of G. P will try to find the runnable G
//     from its own list first, and have a try from the global list if not
//     found. If no runnable G is found in the global neither, P will try to
//     steal from other Ps.
//
//  4. Once one runnable G is found, the P will be bound to G. And at this time,
//     an OS thread (i.e., M) is required to execute the logic of G. Each P has
//     a free list of Ms. P will try to find an idle M in its list, and create
//     a new M if not found. Then the M will be bound to G, and G will be run
//     on the M. After the G runs completed, M and P will be unbound and used
//     in the next scheduler, and M will be put into the free list in P.
//
//  5. If G makes a syscall such as calling C function, G will call
//     `entersyscall` (the entry point of any syscall from GO) to save the GO
//     stack, switch the status of G from running to "syscall blocking", and
//     unbind P from G, before calling into the C codes. In other words, the P
//     might be bound to another G after `entersyscall` (ex: another Goroutine
//     is created at this time and a new round of scheduler starts). M is still
//     bound to G now.
//
//     After `entersyscall`, the M switches to the system stack (the stack in g0
//     which is a special Goroutine created for each M, the stack in g0 is big
//     enough to make cgo call), sets up the registers and calls the C function.
//     When the C function is completed, `exitsyscall` will be called to switch
//     the status of (the original) G from "syscall blocking" to runnable,
//     unbind M from G, and start a new round of scheduler.
//
//     Note: Theoretically, at this stage, the Goroutine (G) does not need to
//     unbind from the Machine (M). The Go runtime does this presumably for the
//     sake of scheduling fairness, to trigger a new scheduling. This practice
//     is also common in other context; for example, in operating systems,
//     returning from a system call is a scheduling point.
//
//     In summary, during calling from GO to C, the P is unbound before calling
//     C function, and the C function runs on the same M.
//
//     Therefore, if the Processor (P) is idle, and there is a Goroutine (G)
//     that is runnable but not yet bound to a P, then that G may be bound to
//     this idle P. At this time, a new M will be created as the previous one is
//     used to execute the C codes now.
//
// So we can say, the maximum of M = the number of concurrent syscall +
// GOMAXPROCS. If we want to limit the maximum of M, we have to limit the number
// of concurrent syscall. That's what withCGO does.
//
// withCGO has two implementations, one is using a goroutine pool (i.e.,
// withCGOPool) and another is using a rate limiter (i.e., withCGOLimiter).
// And we use withCGOLimiter as default.
var withCGO = withCGOLimiter

// withCGOPool executes the function in one worker (i.e., a goroutine) of the
// globalCGOPool, and withCGOPool is a sync call using channels inside. However,
// the fn might not be executed immediately, as the execution timing of the
// worker depends on the golang scheduler.
func withCGOPool(fn func() error) error {
	ec := errChanPool.Get().(chan error)
	defer errChanPool.Put(ec)

	err := globalCGOPool.submit(func() {
		e := fn()
		ec <- e
	})
	if err != nil {
		// Failed to submit task to pool.
		return err
	}

	err = <-ec
	return err
}

// Essentially, the functions `withCGOLimiter` and
// `withCGOLimiterHasReturnValue` serve the same purpose, acting as rate
// limiters for cgo calls. The difference between the two functions lies in
// their return types:
//
// - withCGOLimiter only returns a possible error
// - while withCGOLimiterHasReturnValue returns both a return value and a
//   possible error.
//
// Although it is possible to use withCGOLimiter to pass out a return value
// using the method below, this approach involves heap allocation.
//
//   func func1() {
//		  var (
//			  result T
//			  err error
//		  )
//
//		  _ = withCGOLimiter(func() error {
//			  result, err = fn()
//		  }
//	 }
//
// The `result` and `err` will be allocated on the heap, but not on the stack,
// as they are captured by the closure. That's heap escapes in GO.
//
// Using the `withCGOLimiterHasReturnValue` can avoid the heap escapes.

// withCGOLimiter executes the function surrounded with a rate limiter. The fn
// will be blocked if the rate limit has exceeded, otherwise fn will be executed
// directly.
func withCGOLimiter(fn func() error) error {
	limiter.acquire()
	defer limiter.release()

	err := fn()
	return err
}

// Executes the function surrounded with a rate limiter. The fn will be blocked
// if the rate limit has exceeded, otherwise fn will be executed directly.
func withCGOLimiterHasReturnValue[T any](fn func() (T, error)) (T, error) {
	limiter.acquire()
	defer limiter.release()

	return fn()
}
