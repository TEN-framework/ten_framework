 * @brief Empty function that serves as a breakpoint target for debugging

 * operations fail. When the code is compiled with debug symbols (-g),
 * developers can set a breakpoint on this function to catch and investigate
 * compression-related failures during runtime.
 *
 * The function is called from various places in the decompression code path
 * where errors are detected, providing a centralized location for debugging.

 * @brief Ensures the bit buffer has at least 15 valid bits for decompression.
 *
 * This function is used during decompression to ensure the bit buffer (*pval)
 * contains at least 15 valid bits by reading additional bytes from the input
 * stream as needed. It handles endianness differences when reading 32-bit
 * chunks from the input stream.
 *
 * @param ppin Pointer to the current position in the input stream; updated on
 * return.
 * @param pinend Pointer to the end of the input stream (for bounds checking).
 * @param pval Pointer to the current bit accumulator; updated with new bits.
 * @param pbits Pointer to the count of valid bits in *pval; updated on return.
 *
 * @return 1 on success, 0 if there's not enough input data remaining.
