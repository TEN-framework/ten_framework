/**
 * @brief The enum is used to represent whether the 'on_closed_done()' callback
 * of ten_closeable_t will be invoked in the thread where ten_closeable_t
 * resides.
 *
 * Suppose that there are a 'ten_closeable_t' instance (we named it 'CA'), and
 * another instance (we named it 'CB') are interested in the 'closed' event of
 * CA. After CA is closed, CB will receive the 'on_closed' event of CA, and then
 * CA should receive the 'on_closed_done' acked from CB. As CA and CB might
 * belongs to different threads, the 'on_closed_done' event maybe delivered to
 * CA from other threads, and normally, we prefer to use the runloop tasks to
 * ensure the thread safety in this case. However, the runloop of CA might be
 * already closed before the 'on_closed_done' event being delivered to CA.
 *
 * The logic of closing is determined by the implementation of the runloop, we
 * cannot make any restrictions. In other words, the runloop might or might not
 * be able to deliver events after it is closed.
 *
 * Usually, the existence of the runloop of CA is in the following two forms.
 *
 * - CA owns a runloop.
 *
 *   In this case, the runloop will be closed before the CA is closed, as the
 *   runloop is a resource owned by CA.
 *
 * - CA does not have its own runloop. In this case, CA uses the runloop belongs
 *   to another 'ten_closeable_t' instance (we named it 'CC'). In the semantics
 *   of ten_closeable_t, CA depends on CC.
 *
 *   In this case, CC might start to close itself after it receives the
 *   'on_closed' event of CA. So the runloop could not be used to deliver the
 *   'on_closed_done' event as it might be already closed.
 *
 * Thus, the 'on_closed_done' could be received in the following two conditions.
 *
 * - In the thread of CA.
 *
 *   * Because CA and CB (who is interested in the 'closed' event of CA) are in
 *     the same thread.
 *
 *   * Or because the runloop of CA (including the runloop CA depends on) is
 *     still able to deliver events when it is closed, so CB could deliver the
 *     'on_closed_done()' ack to CA through the runloop of CA.
 *
 * - Out of the thread of CA.
 *
 *   * CA and CB are in the different threads, and the runloop of CA could not
 *     be able to deliver events when it is closed. Therefore, the
 *     'on_closed_done()' of CA would be called in the thread of CB.
 *
 * In the meanwhile, I can not use the runloop of my owner to deliver the
 * 'on_closed_done' event of mine, because not all the 'ten_closeable_t'
 * instances always have an owner.

 *    'ten_closeable_t' are closed.
 *
 * 5) Stage: Close owned non-'ten_closeable_t' resources.

 *
 * 6) Stage: On closed, make a 'closed' announcement.
 *    When a 'ten_closeable_t' is closed completed, it will notify others, who
 *    are interested in my 'closed' event, that I am closed.
 *
 * 7) Stage: All subscribers interested in the 'on_closed' event have completed
 *    handling the 'on_closed' event, then make a 'on_closed_all_done'
 *    announcement. In other words, when a 'ten_closeable_t' receives all the
 *    'on_closed_done' callbacks, it will notify others who are interested in my
 *    'on_closed_all_done' event. Please note that this 'ten_closeable_t' might
 *    be destroyed in this stage by its owner.
