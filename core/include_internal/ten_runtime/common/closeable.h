/**
 * @brief The standard interface for closing a resource.
 *
 * Basically, if A wants to be closed, there are some stages during the closing
 * flow.
 *
 * 1) Stage: Make a 'intend_to_close' announcement.
 *    In this stage, a 'ten_closeable_t' tries to announce the intend_to_close
 *    event to all others who are interested in this event.
 *
 * 2) Stage: Determine the closing root.
 *    In this stage, all possible closing roots will be determined.
 *
 * 3) Stage: Start to close.
 *    In this stage, the closing flow will be started from all roots.
 *
 * 4) Stage: Close owned 'ten_closeable_t' resources.
 *    In this stage, all owned 'ten_closeable_t' resources of a
 *    'ten_closeable_t' are closed.
 *
 * 5) Stage: Close owned non-'ten_closeable_t' resources.
 *    In this stage, all owned non-'ten_closeable_t' resources of a
 *    'ten_closeable_t' are closed.
 *
 * 6) Stage: On closed, make a 'closed' announcement.
 *    When a 'ten_closeable_t' is closed completed, it will notify others, who
 *    are interested in my 'closed' event, that I am closed.
 *
 * 7) Stage: All subscribers interested in the 'on_closed' event have completed
 *    handling the 'on_closed' event, then make a 'on_closed_all_done'
 *    announcement. In other words, when a 'ten_closeable_t' receives all the
 *    'on_closed_done' callbacks, it will notify others who are interested in my
 *    'on_closed_all_done' event. Please note that this 'ten_closeable_t' might
 *    be destroyed in this stage by its owner.

  // We want to use the following coding style to ensure that the
  // 'implementation' is paired one-to-one with 'ten_closeable_t'.
  //
  // - The 'ten_closeable_t' is an embedded member of 'implementation' rather
  //   than a pointer.
  //
  // Ex:
  //   struct some_impl_t {
  //     // other fields.
  //
  //     ten_closeable_t closeable;
  //
  //     // other fields.
  //   }

  // The above example is similar to the following codes in other programming
  // language:
  //
  //   class some_impl_t implements ten_closeable_t;
  //
  // We want to represent the following two key points:
  //
  // 1. The implementation is a kind of 'ten_closeable_t'.
  //
  // 2. One 'ten_closeable_t' could only be paired with one implementation. The
  //    implementation is closing when its embedded 'ten_closeable_t' is
  //    closing; the implementation is closed when its embedded
  //    'ten_closeable_t' is closed.
  //
  // So we keep the offset rather than the raw pointer here.
