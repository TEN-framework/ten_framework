/**
 * @brief As the implementation protocol might have its own runloop, which means
 * that the implementation protocol and ten base protocol (i.e., ten_protocol_t)
 * belongs to different threads. The messages between the implementation
 * protocol and base protocol can not be exchanged directly (i.e., a function
 * should always be called in the same thread). So we provide the
 * 'ten_protocol_asynced_t', which is a bridge between the implementation and
 * base protocols, and the 'ten_protocol_asynced_t' will care about the thread
 * safety of the message exchanging between those two sides. A simple
 * demonstration is as follows.
 *
 * 1) Messages from the implementation protocol to the base protocol:
 *
 * | implementation |  -- sync call --> | ten_protocol_asynced_t |  ---+
 *                                                                     |
 * | base protocol | <-- sync call -- [runloop of base protocol] <-----+
 *
 * 2) Messages from the base protocol to the implementation protocol:
 *
 * | base protocol |  -- sync call --> | ten_protocol_asynced_t |  ----+
 *                                                                     |
 * | implementation | <-- sync call -- [runloop of implementation] <---+
 *
 * Basically, the ten_protocol_asynced_t will hold the runloop of both the
 * implementation protocol and the base protocol.
 *
 * - The runloop of the base protocol will be retrieved by
 *   'ten_protocol_get_attached_runloop(ten_protocol_asynced_t::base)'.
 *
 * - The 'ten_protocol_asynced_t::trigger_impl' is a standard interface that the
 *   implementation must implement, which will be used to submit tasks to the
 *   runloop of the implementation protocol.
 *
 * The apis called from the implementation protocol on the
 * ten_protocol_asynced_t, or the callbacks registered from the implementation
 * protocol in the ten_protocol_asynced_t, are always called synchronously in
 * the implementation thread. In the meanwhile, the apis in the base protocol
 * are always called synchronously in the ten app or engine thread.
 *
 * @note As the ten_protocol_asynced_t is a bridge between two different
 * threads, some fields will be accessed from the implementation thread, and
 * others will be accessed from the ten world. Details are as follows.
 *
 * - The 'base', 'closeable', 'trigger_impl' are accessed fields from the ten
 *   world.
 *
 * - Others are accessed in the implementation thread.
 *
 * Please keep in mind that, _NO_ fields are read or written in both sides.

  /**
   * According to the comments of 'ten_connection_t::migration_state', there
   * might be race conditions if the asynced protocol reads/writes the
   * 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' in the implementation protocol thread.
   *
   * First, the 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' is assigned to 'INIT' in the
   * app thread when the connection (i.e., the 'ten_connection_t' object) is
   * created.
   *
   * Then the implementation protocol will retrieve the value of
   * 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' in its thread when handling the first
   * message, the value will be 'INIT'. The implementation protocol will
   * retrieve the correct value because it access the memory of
   * 'ten_connection_t' after the libws runloop task
   * (ten_libws_worker_on_protocol_created_task). In other words, the reading of
   * 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' is after the writing of
   * 'ten_connection_t::migration_state'. Refer to
   * 'ten_libws_server_on_protocol_created_async()'.
   *
   * But when the migration is completed in the engine thread, there might be
   * race condition when the implementation protocol reads the value. Ex:
   *
   *      | Engine thread           | Implementation protocol thread |
   *      |-------------------------|--------------------------------|
   *   t1 |                         | read state                     |
   *      |-------------------------|--------------------------------|
   *   t2 | write state             |                                |
   *      |-------------------------|--------------------------------|
   *   t3 | acquire in_lock         |                                |
   *      | pop into in_msgs queue  |                                |
   *      |-------------------------|--------------------------------|
   *   t4 |                         | acquire in_lock                |
   *      |                         | push from in_msgs queue        |
   *      |-------------------------|--------------------------------|
   *
   * As the 'write state' and 'read state' operation is not protected by
   * 'in_lock', the above 'write state' and 'acquire in_lock' in the engine
   * thread operations are not atomic, neither are the 'read state' and 'acquire
   * in_lock' in the implementation protocol thread. So the engine thread might
   * acquire the 'in_lock' before the implementation protocol thread (i.e., t3 <
   * t4). In this case, the engine thread could not retrieve the pending
   * messages from the 'in_msgs' list, as the implementation protocol thread has
   * not put the messages into the list yet. And it's too heavy to use the
   * 'in_lock' to protect the 'migration_state'.
   *
   * So, keep a mirror of 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' in the asynced
   * protocol, and obey the following rules.
   *
   * - The 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' will only be accessed in the TEN
   *   world.
   *
   * - The 'ten_protocol_asynced_t::migration_state' will only be accessed in
   *   the implementation protocol thread.
   *
   * - When the migration is completed in the engine thread, or reset in the app
   *   thread (ex, no engine was found), the 'ten_connection_t::migration_state'
   *   will be updated to 'DONE' or 'INIT'. And then
   *   'ten_protocol_asynced_t::migration_state' will be synced through the
   *   runloop task (i.e., the 'ten_protocol_t::on_cleaned_for_external()'
   *   callback) to ensure that the implementation protocol could retrieve the
   *   correct runloop of the connection.
   *
   * And there is no need to use any mutex lock to protect the
   * 'migration_state' in both sides.
   *
   * Refer 'ten_protocol_asynced_on_input_async()' to know about how the
   * 'migrate_state' will be changed.
