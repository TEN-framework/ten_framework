//
// Refer to the comments on 'ten_connection_migrate()' to know about the race
// condition if the implementation protocol reads or writes the
// 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' field. As the race condition exists, the
// 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' can be only accessed from the TEN world
// (i.e., the app and engine thread). The implementation protocol will keep a
// mirror of 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' in its thread locally if it has
// its own thread. Refer to 'ten_protocol_asynced_t::migration_state'. In other
// words, the implementation protocol who implements from
// 'ten_protocol_integrated_t' will not keep a copy of
// 'ten_connection_t::migration_state'. It's safe to read and write
// 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' in those 'synced' protocols, as the reads
// and writes are in sequence, there is only one operation at the same time.
//
// It's safe to get the attached runloop of the connection from the external
// protocol thread, only if the 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' is 'INIT' or
// 'DONE'. As there is no messages been received by the connection when the
// 'ten_connection_t::migration_state' is 'INIT', it means that the connection
// could not be in migration, the owner thread of the connection is always the
// app thread at this time.
//
// The external protocol thread could not read the
// 'ten_connection_t::migration_state', so the implementation protocol must obey
// the following rules.
//
// - Only one message could be transferred to the TEN world _before_ the
//   migration state is completed or reset. The implementation protocol should
//   use the 'migration_state' field in its own thread locally to control the
//   message flow.
//
// - Once the migration is completed or reset in the TEN world, the
//   implementation protocol will receive an event through
//   'ten_protocol_t::on_cleaned_for_external()' callback. The implementation
//   protocol should implements this callback, and updates its own
//   'migrate_state' based on the second parameter (i.e., updates
//   'migration_state' to 'INIT' if the migration is reset in the TEN world,
//   otherwise updates to 'DONE').
//
// - Only try to retrieve the runloop of the connection (i.e., the
//   'ten_connection_t' object) from the external protocol thread when its
//   'migration_state' is 'INIT' or 'DONE'.

  //   other words, the 'graph_id' field of the dest loc of the message is not
  //   empty, or the message is a 'start_graph' cmd (the 'start_graph' cmd
  //   enables a new engine to be created).
  //
  // - Whether the TEN engine runs in its own thread.
  //
  // The above conditions are determined by the TEN app based on the message, so
  // the connection has to transfer at least one message to the TEN app. And as
  // the migration is always asynchronous, the connection could transfer only
  // one message to the TEN app before the migration is completed, otherwise the
  // migration maybe executed twice.

  // The TEN app will create a 'connection' when a client request has been

  // is to avoid memory leakages). If the requests from the connection are sent
  // to a TEN engine who has its own eventloop, the connection must be migrated
  // from the app to the engine before the engine handles any requests from that
  // 'connection'.
  //
  // As the migration is always asynchronous, the following situations may
  // happen simultaneously:
  //
  // - The connection receives a second request from the client side.
  //
  //   > What we have to do is, to ensure that the migration would not be
  //     executed twice. That's why we have to add the 'migration_state' field
  //     here.
  //
  // - The app closes, and the connections in the 'orphan_connections' list will
  //   be closed and destroyed.
  //
  //   > What we have to do is, to ensure that the owner of the connection is
  //     correct. After the migration, the owner of the connection will be the
  //     engine, even if the corresponding 'ten_remote_t' object has not been
  //     created yet. Otherwise, the engine may access the memory which has been
  //     freed by the app. That's what the 'attach_to_type' field does.
  //
  // - The implementation protocol who has its own thread (e.g., the http
  //   protocol) closes, and tries to send a notification to the TEN protocol
  //   through the eventloop. The implementation protocol gets the eventloop of
  //   the TEN protocol based on the 'ten_connection_t::attach_to_type' field.
  //   The implementation protocol might be closed before the migration, in
  //   other words, the 'closing' notification will be sent to the app's
  //   eventloop. But when the migration is completed in the engine thread, the
  //   owner of the connection and the TEN protocol switches to the engine. The
  //   closure of the connection might executes in the wrong thread.
  //
  //   > Briefly, the 'closing' and other events of the connection _must_ happen
  //     after the migration is completed, otherwise it's difficult to ensure
  //     that the correctness of the belonging eventloop.
  //
  // Note that connections will be also created in the 'connect_to' stage
  // (e.g., the client side sends a 'start_graph' cmd, or the extensions send a
  // 'connect_to' cmd), which always happen in the engine thread. So the
  // 'migration_state' is always 'DONE'.
  //
  // Note that this field will be only accessed in the TEN world, the
  // implementation protocol who has its own thread will keep a copy of this
  // field locally.
  //
  // Other modules except 'ten_connection_t' must call
  // 'ten_connection_get_migration_state()' and
  // 'ten_connection_set_migration_state()' to access this field to ensure the
  // thread safety.
