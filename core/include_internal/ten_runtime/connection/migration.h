/**
 * First of all, the connection migration happens only if it receives the first
 * message from the related implementation protocol. The connection attaches to
 * the app at this time.
 *
 * < protocol::in_msgs queue >
 *  | MSG N | ... | MSG 1 |
 *                  ___
 *                   |
 *                   --> Sends the first msg to app's queue.
 *                     |
 *                     -->  Do connection migration. ---
 *                                                     |
 *                                                     |--> Migration is done.
 *
 * After the migration is completed, the connection attaches to the engine or
 * the remote, and then all the messages in the protocol::in_msgs queue could be
 * delivered to the engine's queue.
 *
 * So, one of the specifications of the protocol implementation is to ensure
 * that only one message is delivered to the connection (i.e., calling
 * 'ten_connection_on_msgs()') _before_ the connection migration is totally
 * completed.
 *
 * The processing of the connection migration is expected to be as follows.
 *
 *    |     APP thread      | External protocol thread |    Engine thread   |
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * |   connection::migrate()
 * |

 * l                                          connection::on_protocol_migrated()
