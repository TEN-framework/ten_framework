/**
 * @param schemas_content The schema definition contains the 'property' part.
 * Ex:
 * 1) The definition of the property of extension is as follows:
 *
 *		{
 *				"property": {
 *					"foo": {
 *						"type": "string"
 *					}
 *				},
 *				"cmd_in": []
 *		}
 *
 * 2) The definition of the property of the msg is as follows:
 *
 *		{
 *				"cmd_in": [
 *					{
 *						"name": "demo",
 *						"property": {
 *							"foo": {
 *								"type": "string"
 *							}
 *						},
 *						"required": ["foo"]
 *					}
 *				]
 *		}
 *
 * The type of the property schema is always `ten_schema_object_t` in the
 * schema system. We prefer to parse the `property` schema into a
 * `ten_schema_object_t`, but not a hashmap<name, ten_schema_t>, because some
 * schema definition which is at the same level as `property` (ex: `required`)
 * is used to describe the property.
