 * @brief A buffer structure for reading and parsing DWARF debugging
 * information.
 *
 * This structure maintains the state needed to read DWARF data from a buffer,
 * including position tracking, endianness information, and error handling.
 * It supports operations like reading integers of various sizes, LEB128 values,
 * strings, and other DWARF-specific data formats.
