// Huffman code tables, like the rest of the zlib format, are defined by RFC
// 1951. We store a Huffman code table as a series of tables stored sequentially
// in memory. Each entry in a table is 16 bits. The first, main, table has 256
// entries. It is followed by a set of secondary tables of length 2 to 128
// entries. The maximum length of a code sequence in the deflate format is 15
// bits, so that is all we need. Each secondary table has an index, which is the
// offset of the table in the overall memory storage.
//
// The deflate format says that all codes of a given bit length are
// lexicographically consecutive. Perhaps we could have 130 values that require
// a 15-bit code, perhaps requiring three secondary tables of size 128.  I don't
// know if this is actually possible, but it suggests that the maximum size
// required for secondary tables is 3 * 128 + 3 * 64 ... == 768.  The zlib
// enough program reports 660 as the maximum.  We permit 768, since in addition
// to the 256 for the primary table, with two bytes per entry, and with the two
// tables we need, that gives us a page.
//
// A single table entry needs to store a value or (for the main table only) the
// index and size of a secondary table.  Values range from 0 to 285, inclusive.
// Secondary table indexes, per above, range from 0 to 510.  For a value we need
// to store the number of bits we need to determine that value (one value may
// appear multiple times in the table), which is 1 to 8.  For a secondary table
// we need to store the number of bits used to index into the table, which is 1
// to 7. And of course we need 1 bit to decide whether we have a value or a
// secondary table index.  So each entry needs 9 bits for value/table index, 3
// bits for size, 1 bit what it is.  For simplicity we use 16 bits per entry. */
