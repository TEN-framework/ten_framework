# TEN Framework

**TEN** stands for **Transformative Extensions Network** and represents the Next-Gen AI-Agent Framework, the world's first truly real-time multimodal AI agent framework.

The TEN framework offers the following advantages:

1. **Native Support for High-Performance, Real-Time Multimodal Interactions**
   If your AI applications involve complex audio-visual scenarios, TEN is your go-to solution. It offers high performance and low latency, with extensive optimization of interactions between various extensions to ensure efficient development of AI applications.

2. **Supports Multiple Languages and Platforms**
   Developers can create modular and reusable extensions using various programming languages, such as C++, Go, and Python (with future support for JavaScript/TypeScript). Moreover, the TEN framework runs seamlessly across platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices.

3. **Edge-Cloud Integration**
   Through the TEN framework, extensions deployed across edge and cloud environments can be easily combined to create diverse applications and scenarios. For privacy-sensitive edge deployments, small models leverage local compute power for reduced costs and lower latency, while cloud-based large models can be integrated for an optimal balance of cost and performance.

4. **Flexibility Beyond Model Limitations**
   The TEN framework allows for the creation of complex AI applications that transcend the limitations of large models alone. Agents can be easily constructed to meet a wide range of needs using a simple drag-and-drop, responsive programming approach. TEN also facilitates the integration of AI with audio-visual tools, databases, monitoring systems, RAG, and more.

5. **Real-Time Agent State Management**
   TEN has the ability to manage real-time agent states, enabling dynamic responsiveness and adjustment of agent behavior in real time.

## Use Cases

With the TEN framework, you can easily accomplish the following scenarios. You can see actual demos at [TEN Agent](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent):

1. Simultaneous interpretation
2. Speech-to-text conversion
3. Multilingual chat rooms
4. Audio interaction
5. Audio-visual interaction
6. And more...
