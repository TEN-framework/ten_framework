**TEN** stands for **Transformative Extensions Network**, is a voice agent framework to create conversational AI.

## Features

The TEN framework offers the following advantages:

1. **Native Support for High-Performance, Real-Time Multimodal Interactions**

   If your AI applications involve complex audio-visual scenarios, TEN is your go-to solution. It offers high performance and low latency, with extensive optimization of interactions between various extensions to ensure efficient development of AI applications.

2. **Supports Multiple Languages and Platforms**

   Developers can create modular and reusable extensions using various programming languages, such as C++, Go, and Python (with future support for JavaScript/TypeScript). Moreover, the TEN framework runs seamlessly across platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices.

3. **Edge-Cloud Integration**

   Through the TEN framework, extensions deployed across edge and cloud environments can be easily combined to create diverse applications and scenarios. For privacy-sensitive edge deployments, small models leverage local compute power for reduced costs and lower latency, while cloud-based large models can be integrated for an optimal balance of cost and performance.

4. **Flexibility Beyond Model Limitations**

   The TEN framework allows for the creation of complex AI applications that transcend the limitations of large models alone. Agents can be easily constructed to meet a wide range of needs using a simple drag-and-drop, responsive programming approach. TEN also facilitates the integration of AI with audio-visual tools, databases, monitoring systems, RAG, and more.

5. **Real-Time Agent State Management**

   TEN has the ability to manage real-time agent states, enabling dynamic responsiveness and adjustment of agent behavior in real time.

6. **And more...**

   For more information and detailed documentation on all the capabilities of the TEN framework, please refer to the [TEN framework documentation site](https://doc.theten.ai/).

## Use Cases

With the TEN framework, you can easily accomplish the following scenarios. You can see actual demos at [TEN Agent](https://github.com/ten-framework/ten-agent):

1. **Simultaneous interpretation**

   Real-time language translation during live conversations, enabling smooth cross-language communication without delays.

2. **Speech-to-text conversion**

   Convert spoken language into written text, making it useful for transcribing meetings, interviews, or live talks.

3. **Multilingual chat rooms**

   Create chat rooms where users can communicate in different languages, with automatically translating messages in real time to foster seamless interaction.

4. **Audio interaction**

   Enabling users to communicate with the AI using audio instead of text, which is ideal for hands-free communication or enhancing accessibility.

5. **Audio-visual interaction**

   Combine audio and visual elements to create interactive experiences, such as video conferences with integrated real-time transcription, translation, or even interactive media content.

6. **And more...**

   The flexibility of the TEN framework enables developers to build additional interactive solutions, such as virtual assistants, automated customer support systems, and dynamic multimedia applications.
