# Important Notice

Since the vosk SDK (which includes a header file and a library file) is relatively large, it is not included in this extension by default. You need to manually download the vosk SDK, place the header file (`vosk_api.h`) in the `include/` directory, and place the library file (`libvosk.so`) in the `lib_private/` directory.
