## Line-ending Issues on Windows

Windows users occasionally encounter line-ending issues, which may result in errors like "agent/bin/start is not a valid directory".

To fix this:
1. Configure Git to automatically convert line endings to LF on Windows:

{% code title=">_ Terminal" %}
```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```
{% endcode %}

2. Re-clone the repository

Alternatively, you can download and extract the ZIP file directly from GitHub.
