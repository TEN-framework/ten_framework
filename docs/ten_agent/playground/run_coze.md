# How to make Coze Chat Bot Speak

In this tutorial, we will show you how to make Coze Bot speak in TEN-Agent playground.

## Prerequisites

- Make sure you have the TEN-Agent playground running. If not, follow the [Run Playground](https://doc.theten.ai/ten-agent/quickstart) guide to start the playground.
- You will need following information prepared:
  - Coze info:
    - Coze Bot ID
    - Coze Token
    - Coze Base URL (only needed if you need to access non-global environment)
  - STT info, any supported STT can be used. [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com/) is relatively easy to register and get started with.
  - TTS info, any supported TTS can be used. [Fish.Audio](https://fish.audio/) is relatively easy to register and get started with.
  - RTC info, currently only Agora RTC is supported. You can register your account at [Agora](https://www.agora.io/). We assume you have your App ID and App Certificate ready when you configure your `.env` file.

## Steps

1. Open the playground at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to configure your agent.
2. Select the graph type `voice_assistant`.
3. Click on `Module Picker` to open the module selection.
4. If you preferred STT/TTS module is not by default selected, you can select the module from the dropdown list. Note you will need to configure the module with the correct information like API key, etc.
5. From `LLM` module, click on the dropdown and select `Coze Chat Bot`.
6. Click on `Save Change` to apply the module to the graph.
7. Click on the Button to the right of the graph selection to open the property configuration. You will see a list of properties that can be configured for the `Coze Chat Bot` module.
8. Configure the `Coze Bot ID`, `Coze Token`, and `Coze Base URL` properties with the information you prepared.
9. Click on `Save Change` to apply the property to the `Coze Chat Bot` module.
10. If you see the success toast, the property is successfully applied to the `Coze Chat Bot` module.
11. You are all set! Now you can start speaking to Coze Bot by clicking on the `Connect` button. Note you will need to wait a few seconds for agent to initialzie itself.

## Using Azure STT

Azure STT is integrated within RTC extension module. That's why if you want to use Azure STT, you will need to select `voice_assistant_integrated_stt` graph type.
