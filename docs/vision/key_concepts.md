# Key Concepts

## Modularity

1. **Defined Module Boundaries**: The framework allows for clear definition of control and data plane boundaries, which can be statically declared. This facilitates easy inspection and post-processing using offline tools.

2. **Dynamic Service Composition**: Modules within a process can be dynamically composed at runtime, without the need for static compilation, enabling flexible service configuration.

3. **Streamlined Module Integration**: In scenarios with multiple module compositions, only declarations are required, without modifying any module code or writing glue code.

4. **Decentralized Module Coupling**: The architecture allows for modules to be developed independently by different teams, with no inter-module coupling, facilitating dynamic replacement.

5. **Flexible Module Interface Communication**: Supports two types of interface communicationâ€”one requiring consistent parameters on both sides, and another allowing differences in parameters with platform-provided bridging mechanisms. This flexibility is crucial for independent module development and deployment.

## Orchestration

1. **Directed Cyclic Graph (DCG) Topologies**: Supports complex graph structures for module composition, enabling 1-to-n, n-to-1, and n-to-m interaction relationships in both control and data planes.

2. **Cross-Process and Thread Orchestration**: Allows coordination of module instances across different processes and threads to form complete service scenarios.

3. **Dynamic Orchestration Configuration**: Orchestration can be configured dynamically at runtime or pre-configured before service execution.

## Flexible Configuration Settings

1. **Hierarchical Configuration Support**: Different module instances can have varying configuration possibilities, adaptable across different hierarchical contexts.

2. **Versatile Configuration Capabilities**: Configurations can be preset, dynamically changed during runtime, or distributed as updates.

## Diverse Releasing Capabilities

1. **Support for Binary & Source Release**: Modules can be distributed as source or binary, with both modes coexisting for the same module.

2. **Integration With Cloud Marketplace**: Modules, whether source or binary, can be published to the cloud marketplace for easy download and integration into projects.

## Multiple Instances Capability

1. **Multiple Instances of the Platform**: The platform avoids the use of global variables, supporting multiple instances within a single business process.

2. **Multiple Instances of Each Module**: Modules are developed without reliance on global variables, allowing multiple instances of the same module to run without conflict.

3. **Multiple Instances of Orchestrated Pipelines**: Supports concurrent or sequential execution of multiple orchestrated pipelines within a single process.

## Diverse Distribution Capability

1. **Dynamic Switching of Distribution Configurations**: Modules can be distributed across different processes and threads for high availability, high concurrency, and easier hot-updating.

2. **Decoupling of Distribution Configuration**: Distribution configurations are decoupled from both module code and compilation/build processes, simplifying deployment.

## Flexibility in Input/Output Support

1. **Support for Control and Data Planes**: The framework supports both command invocation and raw data transmission (audio/video/data) between modules.

2. **Support for Inter-process and Inter-thread Communication**: Modules can handle external input/output operations across processes and threads simultaneously.

3. **RPC Essence**: External input/output operations have RPC characteristics, enabling seamless module integration across different processes.

4. **Trigger Multiple Downstream Components**: A single action can trigger multiple downstream modules, with aggregated responses returned to the original module.

5. **Declarative External Input/Output**: Interfaces can be statically declared, allowing for static checks by offline tools.

6. **Simplified External Input/Output Code**: Function call interfaces, ideally auto-generated, simplify coding for module developers.

7. **Support for Non-serializable Data**: The architecture supports transmitting non-serializable data, with tools automatically recognizing and tagging such usage.

8. **Transparent Inter-process Communication**: Underlying transmission logic is abstracted away by the platform, simplifying cross-process interactions.

9. **Support for Synchronous and Asynchronous Control Plane Operations**: The control plane supports both synchronous and asynchronous interactions, allowing for bidirectional command and response flows.

10. **Support for Restricted Execution Context**: Enables synchronous interaction between modules within the same thread.

## Freedom in Developing Modules

1. **Freedom to Use Third-party Libraries**: Modules can freely utilize third-party libraries to achieve desired functionalities.

2. **Freedom to Utilize Operating System Features**: Developers can freely create and terminate native threads within modules, offering maximum development flexibility.

## Programming Language Support

1. **Support for Multiple Programming Languages**: The framework supports modules written in various languages (e.g., C/C++, Go, Java, Python), enabling diverse development environments.

2. **Cross-language Module Integration**: Modules written in different languages can run together within the same process.

3. **Unified Interaction Across Languages**: Modules have consistent interfaces and behaviors across different languages.

4. **Unified Data Types Across Languages**: The platform provides unified data types, ensuring consistent data exchange across different programming languages.

## Rich External Interaction Capabilities

1. **UI Provider**: The architecture supports backend services providing UI components for the frontend.

2. **RESTful Interface**: Backend services can expose RESTful interfaces for client interactions.

3. **Non-intrusive Integration with Existing Services**: The framework can be integrated into existing services without requiring a complete rewrite.

4. **Single-threaded Operation**: The framework can function as a standalone process or as a thread within an existing service, avoiding conflicts with existing business logic.

## Testing Friendly

1. **Diverse Testing Mechanisms**: The framework supports various testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, module testing, and black-box testing.

2. **Independent Module Testing**: Modules can be tested independently, facilitating thorough and effective testing.

## Offline Processing Capability

1. **Package Manager**: The framework includes CLI and package managers for managing modules and their combinations.

2. **Orchestration Tools**: GUI tools are available for offline development and orchestration, enhancing the developer experience.

3. **Visual Debugging Tools**: The architecture supports visual debugging tools to help visualize module interactions.

## Robustness

1. **High Concurrency of Orchestrated Pipelines**: The platform supports at least 100 concurrent instances of orchestrated pipelines within a single process.

2. **High Concurrency of RESTful Interfaces**: The platform can support over 20,000 RESTful clients in a single process.

3. **High Concurrency of Non-RESTful Interfaces**: The platform can support over 1,000 non-RESTful clients in a single process.
