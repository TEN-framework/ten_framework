# Dependencies

The TEN framework utilizes several third-party libraries. Some are used specifically for testing, while others are integrated into the TEN runtime. Below is a description of these libraries, along with any necessary modifications required for their use within the TEN framework.

### Fix for linking mbedtls on Windows

Apply the following patch if the CMake version is higher than 3.24, as `find_package` supports the `GLOBAL` keyword since 3.24.

## curl

Version: 8.1.2

[MIT-like license](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/COPYING)

A command-line tool and library for transferring data with URL syntax, supporting DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, GOPHER, GOPHERS, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, MQTT, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTMPS, RTSP, SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, and TFTP. libcurl offers a myriad of powerful features.

Please refer to `third_party/curl` for details.

### Patches for curl

Patch `lib/CMakeLists.txt`, to change the shared library name from `_imp.lib` to `.lib`.

```cmake
if(WIN32)
  if(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)
    if(MSVC)
      // Add "_imp" as a suffix before the extension to avoid conflicting with
      // the statically linked "libcurl.lib"
      //set_target_properties(${LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES IMPORT_SUFFIX "_imp.lib")
      set_target_properties(${LIB_NAME} PROPERTIES IMPORT_SUFFIX ".lib")
    endif()
  endif()
endif()
```

Export `Curl_ws_done` in `lib/ws.h`, because this function needs to be called to prevent memory leaks.

```c
CURL_EXTERN void Curl_ws_done(struct Curl_easy *data);
// ^^^^^^^^
```
