  # Enable this option if you want to develop rust when enable_sanitizer is

  # follows:
  #
  # 1. There is no opportune time to delete the generated cargo config files
  # during a build.
  # 2. The cargo toolchain supports building rust projects outside of the
  # source folder, i.e., using the --manifest-path option. However, the cargo
  # config only effects on the build in the subfolder of the location of the
  # config file. Ex: in CI, the build runs in a 'out' folder which is outside of
  # the ten_framework folder, if we run `cargo build` in the `out` folder to
  # build ten_rust, the cargo config in the ten_framework folder will be ignored.
