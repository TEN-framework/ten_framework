This example shows how to obtain clasp statistics from the scripting language.
These require external python or lua libraries. The python version also prints
the statistics in a human-readable format (such functionality is not available
in the lua json library used).

Example calls:
    clingo example.lp stats-lua.lp
    clingo example.lp stats-py.lp
