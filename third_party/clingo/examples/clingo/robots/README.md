# A Ricochet Robots Solver

Alex Randolph's board game Ricochet Robots offers a rich and versatile
benchmark for ASP. As it stands, it represents a simple multi-agent planning
problem in which each agent, i.e., robot, has limited sensing capacities (that
is, only bumps are detected).

This little script allows you to first select a target and then move the
robots. If you run out of ideas, you can click on solve! to get a little
help from ASP. To start, call

    python visualize.py
