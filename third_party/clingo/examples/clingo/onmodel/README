This example shows how to use the atoms method to inspect a model found by
clasp.  You can inspect the answer set as well as the assignment that lead to
the model.  Note that there are no guarantees regarding atoms not part of an
answer set because due to simplifications some of them might be removed from
the assignment altogether.

Example calls:
    clingo onmodel-py.lp
    clingo onmodel-lua.lp
