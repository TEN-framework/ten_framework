# Compte the well-founded model of a program

This examples computes the well-founded model of a normal logic program. It
prints true and unknown atoms before solving. Note that it does not print false
atoms because there are in general infinitely many of them.

Disclaimer: Writing an efficient algorithm to compute the well-founded model is
actually quite tricky. This example is not very well tested - there might be
bugs.

## Dependencies

The example needs the clingox and networkx python packages in addition to the
clingo package. The packages can be installed using:

    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ clingo-cffi clingox
    python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade networkx
